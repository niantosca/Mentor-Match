This is a Full-Stack Web Application that I worked on with three other developers. It's aim is to allow the user to either sign up to be a professional mentor to someone, or for the user to search for mentors within their area that work in their current or desired field. When the user searches for a mentor, they do so by zip code and by industry. This queries a database of mentors that fit their criteria and return their contact information. Future development will include log-in verification, mentor/mentee reviews, and implementing Google Maps API.
